# JavaScript Snippets

A collection of tests, snippets, and interview question responses written in Node.

- `experiments` are just me messing around with interesting puzzle ideas or example code. Sometimes I just test stuff out to see how Node/JavaScript handles something.
- `interviewQuestions` are chiefly from the [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/).
- `utils` are functions and helpers that I've written for other projects that will probably come in handy again.
